# Intro-to-AI-N-Queen-Project

## About

This is a final project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class.
We approached finding solutions for N-Queen problem by implementing Backtracking algorithm and Minimum conflict algorithm.
See the FinalProject_submit for summary of this project.
Other files are work-process.

## Algorithm

### Backtracking Algorithm

* It finds the solution in exponential time.

### Minimum conflict Algorithm

* Time complexity is linear time when optimized.

### Minimum conflict with Backtracking Algorithm

* Tried to optimize minimum conflict with backtracking.
